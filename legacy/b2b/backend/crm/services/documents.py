"""Shared document-rendering helpers — the seller branding pipeline for every PDF.

One place resolves the branding bundle (issuing company + its CompanyDocumentProfile +
logo URL) that every seller-issued document PDF (КП / договор / инвойс / акт) extends the
shared base template `crm/templates/crm/_document_base.html` with. Keeping the four builders
on an identical context shape is what makes the documents read as one product (ADR-0006
document-polish P1). Rule 8: logic lives here; the render functions are thin.
